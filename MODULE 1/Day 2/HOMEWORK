ASSIGNMENT RULES
- All the answers must be in JavaScript
- You can ask for tutor's help
- The solution must be available for the tutors by the end of the day
- You can google / use StackOverflow BUT we suggest you to use just the material provided
- You can test your code in a separate file or commenting the single parts in this file or directly in the Developer Console or in the Node Console.

/* EXERCISE 1
Write the code to execute a SUM between the number 12 and 20
*/

console.log(12+20);

/* EXERCISE 2
Create a variable named X containing the number 12
*/
let X = 12;

/* EXERCISE 3
Create a variable named name containing the string John Doe
*/

let name = "John Doe";

/* EXERCISE 4
Execute a DIFFERENCE between the number 12 and the variable X, which stores the value 12
*/

let x = 12;
console.log(12-x);

// * EXERCISE 5
// Create two variables: name1 and name 2. name1 is equal to john, name2 is equal to John.
// Verify that name1 is different from name2. 
// Verify then, that name1 and name2 are equals if both lowercase (without changing the value of name2)

let name1 = "john";
let name2 = "John";

// or
console.log(name1 !== name2);

    console.log("Equal");
}else{
    console.log("Names are not equal")
}

/* EXERCISE 6
Create the variable X (value less than 10). Write the code to print the literal value of the given number (ex.: 1 => one, 5 => five)
*/

let X = 5;

if (X=1){
    console.log("one");

}else if(X=4){
    console.log("four");

/* EXERCISE 7
Insert a value in a variable based on the result of a ternary if
*/

let nr1 = 1;
let nr2 = 2;

let result;
result = (nr1 < nr2) ? 'true' : 'false'

/* WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
Send the code via Slack to the tutor! In the next days we'll also learn how to use GIT
